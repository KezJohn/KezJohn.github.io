								</header>
								<p style="color: #2c3e50;">
									This project was completed during my sophomore year, with the illustrations presented here being a portion of the overall project and presentation. The report analyzes spill incidents across New York State from 2000 to 2023, using data sourced from data.ny.gov: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/spill-incidents. It highlights trends, geographic patterns, and material-specific spill incidents. By utilizing Tableau's visualization features, I aimed to identify insights and predict future spill trends.

												The trend analysis, displayed as a line graph, illustrates the fluctuation of spill incidents from 2000 to 2023. The categories are color-coded: green for petroleum, blue for hazardous materials, red for oxygenates, and orange for others. Over the years, the graph emphasizes a declining trend in spill incidents, with petroleum spills being the most prominent. The sharp reduction in spills after 2020 indicates enhanced safety measures, though petroleum continues to require careful monitoring. Other materials consistently show low spill counts, demonstrating effective handling practices.

								</header>
								
								<p style="color: #2c3e50;">In conclusion, spill incidents across New York State from 2000 to 2023 posed significant risks to counties like Westchester and Onondaga. The trend analysis highlights a notable decline in overall incidents, particularly after 2020, demonstrating the impact of enhanced safety measures and regulations. However, the dual map for 2022 reveals that Onondaga reported the highest number of spills (210), primarily due to petroleum, which remains a critical concern. Forecasts indicate a potential increase, with an estimated 9,056 petroleum-related spills in 2025, driven by unpredictable factors. This emphasizes petroleum's pivotal role in spill incidents, while hazardous materials, though minimal, still contribute to the issue.With diligent efforts from state and county authorities, these predictions can be mitigated, ensuring further progress in spill prevention and environmental safety.

									<p style="color: #2c3e50;">
										This graph highlights spending patterns and affordability across different skin types. Consumers with normal skin show flexibility, purchasing products across both affordable and luxurious price ranges. Those with combination skin have the widest spending capacity, choosing products in any price category. In contrast, individuals with oily skin predominantly purchase affordable products, with average costs below $50, and have limited options in higher price ranges. Meanwhile, dry skin consumers, like those with combination skin, can afford mid-range products priced between $50 and $100. Notably, all skin types have access to products under $50, ensuring affordability for a broad consumer base. However, oily skin stands out as the only group with minimal options in the luxury price range. These findings emphasize the importance of offering products at various price points to cater to the diverse needs of consumers based on their skin type.

					<p style="color: #2c3e50;">
						This project delves into the analysis of chronic diseases using patient health data from 2022. The primary focus is on identifying trends based on Body Mass Index (BMI) and diabetes status while evaluating associated risk categories. The aim is to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions by presenting clear visualizations of data and offering actionable insights. The analysis is categorized by gender and age group, providing a comprehensive view of health risks in different demographics.

										The data highlights significant chronic disease concerns, particularly in specific demographics. Among the "Old Age" group, obesity is alarmingly high, with 200 cases, and overweight cases are equally distributed between men and women. Middle-aged males emerge as a high-risk group, with a noticeable trend of morbid obesity, posing severe health risks and requiring immediate intervention. Additionally, men account for approximately 60% of obesity and diabetes cases, underscoring a pronounced gender disparity in chronic disease prevalence. While older adults and middle-aged males face the highest burden of chronic conditions, young adults also exhibit diabetes issues, though at comparatively lower levels. This early emergence of diabetes in younger demographics warrants closer monitoring to prevent escalation. Overall, the analysis identifies old-age individuals and middle-aged males as the most vulnerable, emphasizing the need for targeted health strategies while keeping an eye on emerging risks in younger populations.
