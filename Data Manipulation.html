				The analysis of the 2022 U.S. Household Income Dataset provides valuable insights into state-level income trends and geographical characteristics. The study identifies the states with the largest land and water areas, ranking the top 10 in each category to highlight geographical disparities. By examining state-level household income statistics, the analysis determines the states with the highest and lowest incomes based on average mean and median values. The results reveal significant variations, with municipalities and Census Designated Places (CDPs) showing the highest household incomes, while urban and community areas reflect lower averages. These findings suggest notable economic and demographic differences across regions. Additionally, the analysis uncovers that states with larger geographical areas do not always correspond to higher income levels, emphasizing the complexity of economic factors. This project showcases the ability to integrate geographic and economic datasets using SQL, delivering meaningful insights and demonstrating advanced data analysis skills.</p>

				<h1 style="color: #503414; font-size: 30px;">Chronic Disease Analysis(Excel)</h1>
			</header>
			<p style="color: #2c3e50;">
				This analysis offers valuable insights into the relationship between chronic conditions like diabetes and associated health factors such as lipid profiles, BMI, and age. By categorizing data into meaningful groups, it reveals patterns such as the heightened risk of diabetes among individuals with higher BMI or poor cholesterol health. The study emphasizes the critical role of preventive measures, including weight management and lipid monitoring, in reducing the prevalence and severity of diabetes. These findings can guide targeted interventions, such as lifestyle modifications or medical treatments, to mitigate chronic disease risks. Furthermore, the analysis highlights disparities in health outcomes across different age groups and genders, enabling more personalized and effective healthcare strategies. This approach not only supports better disease management but also contributes to broader public health improvements by addressing root causes and promoting early detection.</p>

					<h1 style="color: #503414; font-size: 30px;">Student Performance Factors(SQL)</h1>
				</header>
				<p style="color: #2c3e50;">
					This analysis provides a comprehensive look into the factors affecting student performance and offers actionable insights for educators, parents, and policymakers. By examining variables like sleep hours, physical activity, attendance, teacher quality, and school type, we uncovered key trends that can drive improvements in educational outcomes. For instance, it was evident that students sleeping less than six hours performed poorly, achieving only up to a 'C' grade, highlighting the critical role of adequate rest in academic success. Teacher quality emerged as a significant determinant, with high-quality teaching consistently leading to better exam scores. Additionally, the study compared public and private schools, revealing differences in performance levels tied to institutional support. Physical activity was also analyzed, showing how it correlates with attendance, sleep, and academic achievement. This analysis equips stakeholders with data-driven insights to implement targeted interventions, promoting better learning environments and fostering student well-being and success.</p>
